    "Suppose a company claims that the average weight of their cereal boxes is 500 grams, with a known population standard deviation of 10 grams. To verify this claim, a quality control manager collects a large sample of cereal boxes and measures their weights. Since the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, the manager can perform a z-test to test if the average weight is indeed 500 grams."
